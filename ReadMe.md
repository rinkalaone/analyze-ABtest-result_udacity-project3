## Project 3 - Practical Statistics - "Analyze A/B Test Results"
### by Karine Legrand

### from the "Data Analyst Nanodegree Program" - Udacity Certificate

#### This project consisted in working through a jupyter notebook exercise, to gain a solid understanding of A/B tests, which are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. We analyzed the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Our goal was to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

#### Learning goals:
 - apply inferential statistics and probability methods
 - apply "Hypothesis testing" method
 - build supervised learning model like "Logistic Regression test"

#### The Steps taken to achieve this analysis are described in the jupyter notebook _"Analyze_ab_test_Project.ipynb"_.<br>To use the Table of Contents (not working when viewing the notebook directly in GitHub), view the notebook with "nbviewer" by clicking this link:

#### The review from a Udacity mentor, is included in _"mentor_review.pdf"_, validating that the project passed successfully for certification

The dataset was imported from a CSV file _"ab_data.csv"_, _not_ included in this repository.

The Project includes references to quiz exercises, (parts of the lessons material from Udacity), that are not included in the repository, but not mandatory to follow/understand the results and answers provided.
